== Reading Kernel Memory ==

There are several ways on OS X (as of this writing, 10.7.3) to read Kernel Memory:

(1) Download MacMemoryReader 
[http://www.cybermarshal.com/index.php/cyber-marshal-utilities/mac-memory-reader]
Without using their program, look in 'supportfiles' for the devmem 10X 
for your version of OS X:

../MacMemoryReader/supportfiles/
├── PE_state_raw.dtrace
├── devmem.104x.tgz
├── devmem.105x.tgz
├── devmem.106x.tgz
├── devmem.107x.tgz

$ tar xzf devmem.107x.tgz
# chown -R root:wheel devmem.kext
# kextload devmem.kext

(2) Follow the Chapter 8 guide from OS X Internals
[http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/chapter8/kma/]

This requires you to compile a KernelMemoryAccess driver using Xcode. I tried
for a few minutes to write a Makefile for it without success. And I wasn't able 
to compile without XNU version 1228.9.59.

(3) Set kmem=1 in your boot-args through nvram
Check to make sure you don't have any existing boot-args

$ nvram -p | grep boot-args

If you do, make sure you include them:

# nvram boot-args="kmem=1"

(4) Create an OS X VMware Virtual Machine using VMware Fusion, then use the 
corresponding *.vmem file.

(5) Others, like reading the memory using RDMA.
